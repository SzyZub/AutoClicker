An autoclicker made in c++ with the use of "wxWidgets" graphical library 

![ScreenShot](https://github.com/SzyZub/AutoClicker/blob/master/ScreenShots/1.png)

Sidenotes:

It will click even if not in the window itself.

If not in the window, setting the coordinates will shift the focus from the program(will show the one you clicked on)

You can set the interval from 5 to 10000 ms(in theory).

The miliseconds between clicks is NOT accurate at very low intervals.

The x/y coordinates are min 0, max 4000/2000 pixels.

The "click limit"(if you want to set it) is max 10000 and min 1.
